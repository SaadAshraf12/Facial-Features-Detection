How to Run the Script:

1- Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

2- Make sure the image you want to analyze is available and update its path in the script:
image_path = "your-image-name.jpg"

3- Install the required Python libraries by running:
pip install opencv-python mediapipe matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow

4- Ensure the following files and directories are present in your project folder:
a- gender_classification_saved_model/best_model_finetuned.keras
b- glasses_classification_saved_model/best_model_finetuned.keras

The image file to test (e.g. sample.jpg)

5- Run the Python script using a command-line interface or from your IDE:
python script_name.py

6- The script will:
a- Detect the face using MediaPipe
b- Predict gender (male or female)
c- Predict presence of glasses (glasses or no glasses)
d- Estimate dominant shirt color using upper-body keypoints and color clustering
e- Print results in the console
f- Display the image with bounding box and prediction labels using matplotlib
